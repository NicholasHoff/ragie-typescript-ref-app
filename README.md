## Intent

This is an example project to demonstrate the features of ragie.ai's [typescript client](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ragie). It may also be used to add documents to your ragie.ai tenant and test retrieving results.

`RAGIE_API_KEY=<YOUR_KEY>`

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or
pnpm dev
# or

```
